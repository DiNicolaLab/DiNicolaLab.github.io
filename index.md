We study _how_ our brains support complex cognitive functions to better understand _why_ human minds are both flexible and vulnerable to psychopathology. 

Humans are fascinating! We can recall past experiences, consider friends' feelings, imagine new scenarios and communicate through language. Our research grapples with how our brains support our capacities for complex thoughts. See the "Research" tab for more details! 

We are recruiting team members! See the "Join Us!" tab for more information!
